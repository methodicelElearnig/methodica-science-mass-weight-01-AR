// ============================================================
//  UNIT MANIFEST — yaad4-science-mass-weight-01
//  Single source of truth for "how many components, which global screen
//  numbers each one owns" — read by the production root shell (index.html +
//  unit-shell.js) to know which component folder to load for a given
//  global screen, WITHOUT ever needing to load all 6 component iframes
//  simultaneously just to sum their live DEV_READY totals.
//
//  Unlike methodica-math-percent-06 (whose components each restart their
//  own screen numbering at 0, requiring a local<->global offset
//  conversion), Mass & Weight's components already carry GLOBAL
//  `data-screen` values baked into their own HTML/JS (see each
//  component's js/main.js — `goTo(n)` matches by `data-screen` value, not
//  DOM position). So this manifest does no offset arithmetic at all — it
//  is purely an ownership lookup: "which component owns global screen N".
//
//  `screens` is an EXPLICIT array of the real global screen numbers each
//  component renders — not a [start, end] range — because component 05's
//  real screens are 35,36,37,38,41,43: screen 40 was removed as an
//  orphaned/fabricated screen, and screens 39 and 42 (the sugar-cube and
//  moon advanced questions) were later cut from the unit — none of the
//  three must ever be treated as if they exist (see
//  methodica-science-mass-weight-01-05/index.html, the removed-screen
//  comments near data-screen="40"/"39"/"42"). Expanding a numeric range
//  would silently invent these phantom screens; an explicit array cannot.
// ============================================================

  // Trailing-slash directory form, not an explicit '.../index.html' filename:
  // some static hosts (e.g. the local `serve` dev server) 301-redirect a
  // request for '.../index.html' to the bare directory path WITHOUT a
  // trailing slash ('.../methodica-science-mass-weight-01-01', no slash) —
  // the browser then resolves that component's own relative <script>/<link>
  // tags one directory too shallow, loading the wrong files entirely. A
  // trailing-slash request is never subject to that redirect (there's no
  // '.html' to strip) and every static host already auto-serves index.html
  // for a directory request, so this is strictly safer with no downside.
